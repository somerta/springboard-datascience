##THIS IS THE FIRST DRAFT
## Requirements for proposal

Finalize one Capstone idea based on the feedback you got from mentor(s) and peers on your Section 1 submission, and also based on your newly acquired understanding of the R ecosystem. Think of the following questions:

* What is the problem you want to solve?

* Who is your client and why do they care about this problem? In other words, what will your client DO or DECIDE based on your analysis that they wouldn't have otherwise?

* What data are you going to use for this? How will you acquire this data?

* In brief, outline your approach to solving this problem (knowing that this might change later).

* What are your deliverables? Typically, this would include code, along with a paper and/or a slide deck.

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
